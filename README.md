# Pinyin-Keyboard
Writing Pinyin is rather annoying if you want to do it in an aesthetically appealing way. To use this, you just type in it and it'll automatically convert whatever you write so you don't have the ugly numbers hanging around at the end of syllables. It'll assume you know what you're doing, so it won't handle typos for you.
