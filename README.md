# Pinyin-Converter
Writing Pinyin is rather annoying if you want to do it in an aesthetically appealing way. Rather simple, little application. You just type pinyin (use '1' at the end of a syllable for first tone, '2' for second, '3' for third, and '4' for forth. Don't type '0' for the neutral tone) and either hit enter or click the 'convert' button.
